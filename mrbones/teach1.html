    <p>What is Dankizn? That is the question that many new, young disciples ask me. To answer that question, though, we first much journey into the very origins of this world.</p>
    <p>In the beginning, it is said that there was nothing.</p>
    <p>The universe as we know it simply did not exist.</p>
    <p>In a way unfathomable to us who are limited to existence within our own vessels, everything was nothing.</p>
    <p>That was, until Jesus Kang.</p>
    <p>Through means we will likely never be able to understand, Jesus Kang was able to exist in nothing.</p>
    <p>And, for reason not understood, Jesus Kang would then go on to create the universe as we know it</p>
    <p>He did this monumental act, simply by expanding his dong.</p>
    <p>His dong, the first true example of matter to exist in the nothingness of the primordial universe, became the universe.</p>
    <p>He looked into the universe from outside it, and he understood everything.</p>
    <p>But, he could not truly do anything if he was to simply remain outside of the universe.</p>
    <p>So, he transfered his mind into an immortal body that he created inside of his dong, and entered the universe.</p>
    <p>For a while, he roamed, exploring his creations.</p>
    <p>Space, stars, galaxies, they are all beautiful to us.</p>
    <p>But to Jesus Kang, who was before all, and had seen everything without the lenses of a mortal body.</p>
    <p>Beauty, held no meaning, nor did fascination.</p>
    <p>He was beggining to become bored, as he had no stimuli to keep him entertained at all.</p>
    <p>So, he created life on the rocky planet we now know as Earth.</p>
    <p>He split his soul into many, many, pieces, and made a pool out of it</p>
    <p>Each new living being took part of his soul from the pool, and could, in their mortal body, experience the universe.</p>
    <p>In essence, allowing Jesus Kang himself to experience.</p>
    <p>Eventually, this life became very complex, and displayed evidence of intelligence</p>
    <p>He deicded to bless his favorite life, specifically, the ancestors of the gorillas.</p>
    <p>But this blessing did not last long, for the creatures stole his supply of bananas-- the holy food that contains the energy that powers the very soul.</p>
    <p>Instead, Jesus Kang then favoured a different, similar species, humans.</p>
    <p>He watched over them, and provided them great power</p>
    <p>He granted them access to the holy energies: Slam Energy, Banana Energy, Dank Power, and, most powerful of all, Jam Essence.</p>
    <p>With these powers, humans quickly rose to the top of Earth.</p>
    <p>They became more advanced, too, eventually forming civilizations.</p>
    <p>To help him watch over the humans, he decided to create a son.</p>
    <p>This son, would be named Dankey Kang.</p>
    <p>After this, there was a long period of harmony between Jesus Kang, Dankey Kang, and the humans.</p>
    <p>The two kangs and the humans even mingled a bit.</p>
    <p>Through the wombs of several human women, Dankey Kang would have 23 sons and daughters, who would become known as the Kongs.</p>
    <p>The Kongs had powers similar to a Kang, but were not nearly as powerful.</p>
    <p>Jesus Kang would do the same, having seven children of his own.</p>
    <p>The seven children would become known as the Lower Kangs</p>
    <p>Their power has near the level of Dankey Kang.</p>
    <p>With this, the Kangs and Kongs were born, and the humans, with their support, were growing every day.</p>
    <p>Things would carry on in this manner for a while, until eventually, tragedy struck.</p>
    <p>But that, is a story for next time.</p>
